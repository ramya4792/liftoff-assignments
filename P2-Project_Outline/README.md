# Project Outline

### Overview
	My Project will be a Book Sharing that will allow users to search a book and the user can swap, rent or buy available books. It will allow users to login in and enter the book that they have by adding Title and Author of the book. It will also allow the users to search the book without logging in. User can sort/filter the results and also do an advanced search for the book they want.

	The idea of this project came when my mentor shares the best books and some useful websites for further learning, for a moment I feel like why can’t all these in a one place. Then I decided to place them in one place and after that I thought those who bought a book for reference and used only once or twice can share the book for others who are in need. So, I decided to make book sharing web app.

### Features

* Search the book: Users will be able to search the book by using title of the book.
* Advanced Search: Users will be able to search the book by providing additional features like keywords, language, publisher and copy of the book(soft/hard) etc...
* Sort/Filter the results: Users will be able to Sort the books according to Title, Rating and Price and also users can filter the results by Subject, available to free/rent/buy and rating of the book.

### What I'll Have to Learn
For the payment option, I don’t have any idea how to maintain confidential details about the card and how to authorize it.
I’ll have to dive deep into how to filter the results and perform advanced search.
